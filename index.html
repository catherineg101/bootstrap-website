      <p class="card-text">The memes that circulated on the platform transcended virality, resonating with viewers and showing the impact Vine had on Internet culture. These funny 6-second clips not only became viral content but also served as inside jokes among friends in conversations, creating a sense of community. Unusually enough, these videos by everyday people not only entertained others but also opened doors to professional opportunities to those memed.</p>

          <p>When I discovered this app, it was a part of my early preteen years, one of the many apps I grew up on. It made me want to delve more into creating content that was hilarious and fun for my friends to view. Because it had a short time limit, you had to come up with something quick and were forced to choose only the most funny portion of an idea or it could simply be unintentional and random. I was able to discover music and Vine also created a community where users could collaborate, especially in editing. I used to amateurly make edits during that time, and now editing communities thrive on TikTok. With TikTok, a newer social media platform that has risen in popularity in recent years, the idea is still replicated from the original foundations of Vine. Although Vine is gone, it's never forgotten.</p>
